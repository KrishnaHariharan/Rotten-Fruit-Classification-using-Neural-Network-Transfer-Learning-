# Rotten-Fruit-Classification-using-Neural-Network-Transfer-Learning-
Images are an important source of data and information in the agricultural sciences. Fruit classification is an important task in markets because of the similarity of different fruits. They could be used in industries to detect a specific fruit and segregate them separately from a conveyor with various fruits. Therefore, automatic fruit classification is necessary and urgent.
The main objective of this project is to classify whether the given image  of fruits (apples/orange/banana) are fresh or rotten. To detect the fruits are fresh or rotten by using transfer learning techniques. The main objective of this project is classify whether the given image is rotten apple/banana/orange or fresh apple/banana/orange.VGG16 convolution neural network is used. Transfer learning is done with a fully connected layer on top of vgg16
I have attached the source code for the project in .ipynb format and also in pdf format with detailed explanation below each line for better understanding. The results of the prediction and also loss function plot is also uploaded here for reference.
